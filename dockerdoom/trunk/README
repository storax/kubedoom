psdoom-ng is based on Chocolate Doom and psDooM code bases.  psDooM
was based on xdoom.  Chocolate Doom's engine was chosen for several 
reasons.  psdoom-ng was ment to be a lightweight process killer 
comparable to 2D versions of process management.  Chocolate Doom uses 
SDL which makes it compatible with Windows, MacOS.  We hope to port 
psdoom-ng to popular platforms such as MacOS and Windows.

psdoom-ng is a Doom source port which aims to behave as closely
as possible to the original DOS Doom executables.

psdoom-ng aims to:

 * Be lightweight and simple process manager
 * Crossplatform 3D Process Manager
 * Allow system administrators actually kill programs
 * Expose or visualize hidden and zombies processes
 * Expose current users or ttys as avatars.

== Setting up gameplay ==

For instructions on how to set up psdoom-ng for play, see the
INSTALL file.

== Configuration File ==

psdoom-ng is compatible with the DOS Doom configuration file
(normally named 'default.cfg').  Existing configuration files for DOS
Doom should therefore simply work out of the box.  However, Chocolate
Doom also provides some extra settings.  These are stored in a
separate file named 'chocolate-doom.cfg'.

The configuration can be edited using the chocolate-setup tool.

== Command-line options ==

For a complete list of command-line options, see the CMDLINE file.

== Playing TCs ==

With Vanilla Doom there is no way to include sprites in PWAD files.
psdoom-ng's '-file' command line option behaves exactly the same
as Vanilla Doom, and trying to play TCs by adding the WAD files using
'-file' will not work.

Many Total Conversions (TCs) are distributed as a PWAD file which must
be merged into the main IWAD.  Typically a copy of DEUSF.EXE is
included which performs this merge.  psdoom-ng includes a new
option, '-merge', which will simulate this merge.  Essentially, the
WAD directory is merged in memory, removing the need to modify the
IWAD on disk.

To play TCs using psdoom-ng, run like this:

  psdoom -merge thetc.wad

Here are some examples:

  psdoom -merge batman.wad -deh batman.deh vbatman.deh  (Batman Doom)
  psdoom -merge aoddoom1.wad -deh aoddoom1.deh  (Army of Darkness Doom)

   classic TCs, is available on the psdoom-ng website:

   You are encouraged to sign up and contribute any useful information
   you may have regarding the port!

 * psdoom-ng is not perfect.  Although it aims to accurately
   emulate Vanilla Doom, some of the behavior of Vanilla Doom can be
   very difficult to reproduce. Because of the nature of the project,
   you may also encounter Vanilla Doom bugs; these are intentionally
   present; see the NOT-BUGS file for more information.

   New bug reports can be submitted to the psdoom-ng bug tracker
   on Github.  See:
