1.6.0 (2011-05-17):

     * The instructions in the INSTALL file are now customized for
       different platforms, and each binary package contains a version
       with instructions specific to the platform that it is
       targetting.  This should help to avoid confusion that some
       users have reported experiencing.
     * The display settings window in the setup tool has been
       reorganised to a better arrangement.
     * It is now possible to load .lmp files (and play back demos)
       with long filenames (thanks blzut3).
     * In the setup tool, it is now possible to hold down shift when
       changing key/mouse/joystick bindings to prevent other bindings
       to the same key from being cleared (thanks myk).
     * The joystick menu in the setup tool now has a test button
       (thanks Alexandre Xavier).
     * Specifying the -privateserver option implies -server (thanks
       Porsche Monty).
     * The Mac OS X .dmg package now has a background and looks generally
       more polished.
     * In Mac OS X, it is now possible to simply double click an IWAD
       file in the Finder to configure its location within the launcher.
     * Freedesktop.org desktop files are now installed for Doom and
       the setup tool, which will appear in the main menu on desktop
       environments such as Gnome and KDE (thanks Adrián Chaves
       Fernández).
     * The Chex Quest dehacked patch (chex.deh) will now be detected
       if it is in the same directory as the IWAD file.

    Compatibility:
     * Added support for the alternate version of the Final Doom
       executable included in some later versions of the Id Anthology.
       This version fixed the demo loop crash that occurred with the
       "original" Final Doom executable.

       This executable can be selected on the command line with
       -gameversion final2. It has been made the default when playing
       with the Final Doom IWADs (the original behavior can be
       selected with -gameversion final).  (thanks Porsche Monty,
       Enjay).
     * Very short sound effects are not played, to better emulate the
       behavior of DMX in Vanilla Doom (thanks to Quasar for help in
       investigating this).
     * The null sector dereference emulation code has been imported
       from Prboom+ - this fixes a desync with CLNJ-506.LMP (thanks
       entryway).
     * The IDMUS cheat doesn't work when emulating the v1.9 executable
       (thanks Alexandre Xavier).

    Bugs fixed:
     * Menu navigation when using joystick/joypad (thanks Alexandre
       Xavier).
     * For configuration file value for shift keys, use scan code for
       right shift, not left shift (thanks Alexandre Xavier).
     * Default joystick buttons for the setup tool now match Vanilla
       (thanks twipley).
     * Visual Studio project files work again (thanks GhostlyDeath).
     * The default sfx/music volume set by the setup tool is now 8
       instead of 15, matching the game itself. (thanks Alexandre
       Xavier).
     * Weapon cycling from the shotgun to the chaingun in Doom 1 now
       works properly (thanks Alexandre Xavier).
     * MIDI playback that locked up when using an empty MUS / MIDI
       file (thanks Alexandre Xavier).
     * Default sampling rate used by setup tool changed to 44100Hz, to
       match the game default (thanks Alexandre Xavier).
     * Cheat codes and menu hot keys now work when shift is held down
       or capslock turned on (thanks Alexandre Xavier).

    libtextscreen:
     * The background on GUI controls now lights up when hovering over
       them, so that it is more obvious what you are selecting.
     * It is now possible to type a '+' in input boxes (thanks
       Alexandre Xavier).
     * It is possible to use the mouse wheel to scroll through scroll
       panes.
     * Clicking on scroll bars now moves the scroll handle to a
       matching location.
     * Clicking outside a dropdown list popup window now dismisses the
       window.
     * Window hotkeys that are an alphabetical letter now work when
       shift is held down or capslock turned on (thanks Alexandre
       Xavier).

1.5.0 (2011-01-02):

    Big changes in this version:
     * The DOSbox OPL emulator (DBOPL) has been imported to replace
       the older FMOPL code.  The quality of OPL emulation is now
       therefore much better.
     * The game can now run in screen modes at any color depth (not
       just 8-bit modes).  This is mainly to work around problems with
       Windows Vista/7, where 8-bit color modes don't always work
       properly.
     * Multiplayer servers now register themselves with an Internet
       master server.  Use the -search command line parameter to
       find servers on the Internet to play on.  You can also use
       DoomSeeker (http://skulltag.net/doomseeker/) which supports
       this functionality.
     * When running in windowed mode, it is now possible to
       dynamically resize the window by dragging the window borders.
     * Names can be specified for servers with the -servername command
       line parameter.
     * There are now keyboard, mouse and joystick bindings to cycle
       through available weapons, making play with joypads or mobile
       devices (ie. without a proper keyboard) much more practical.
     * There is now a key binding to change the multiplayer spy key
       (usually F12).
     * The setup tool now has a "warp" button on the main menu, like
       Vanilla setup.exe (thanks Proteh).
     * Up to 8 mouse buttons are now supported (including the
       mousewheel).
     * A new command line parameter has been added (-solo-net) which
       can be used to simulate being in a single player netgame.
     * There is now a configuration file parameter to set the OPL I/O
       port, for cards that don't use port 0x388.
     * The Python scripts used for building Chocolate Doom now work
       with Python 3 (but also continue to work with Python 2)
       (thanks arin).
     * There is now a NOT-BUGS file included that lists some common
       Vanilla Doom bugs/limitations that you might encounter
       (thanks to Sander van Dijk for feedback).

    Compatibility:
     * The -timer and -avg options now work the same as Vanilla when
       playing back demos (thanks xttl)
     * A texture lookup bug was fixed that caused the wrong sky to be
       displayed in Spooky01.wad (thanks Porsche Monty).
     * The HacX v1.2 IWAD file is now supported, and can be used
       standalone without the need for the Doom II IWAD (thanks
       atyth).
     * The I_Error function doesn't display "Error:" before the error
       message, matching the Vanilla behavior.  "Error" has also been
       removed from the title of the dialog box that appears on
       Windows when this happens.  This is desirable as not all such
       messages are actually errors (thanks Proteh).
     * The setup tool now passes through all command line arguments
       when launching the game (thanks AlexXav).
     * Demo loop behavior (ie. whether to play DEMO4) now depends on
       the version being emulated.  When playing Final Doom the game
       will exit unexpectedly as it tries to play the fourth demo -
       this is Vanilla behaviour (thanks AlexXav).

    Bugs fixed:
     * A workaround has been a bug in old versions of SDL_mixer
       (v1.2.8 and earlier) that could cause the game to lock up.
       Please upgrade to a newer version if you haven't already.
     * It is now possible to use OPL emulation at 11025Hz sound
       sampling rate, due to the new OPL emulator (thanks Porsche
       Monty).
     * The span renderer function (used for drawing floors and
       ceilings) now behaves the same as Vanilla Doom, so screenshots
       are pixel-perfect identical to Vanilla Doom (thanks Porsche
       Monty).
     * The zone memory system now aligns allocated memory to 8-byte
       boundaries on 64-bit systems, which may fix crashes on systems
       such as sparc64 (thanks Ryan Freeman and Edd Barrett).
     * The configure script now checks for libm, fixing compile
       problems on Fedora Linux (thanks Sander van Dijk).
     * Sound distortion with certain music files when played back
       using OPL (eg. Heretic title screen).
     * Error in Windows when reading response files (thanks Porsche
       Monty, xttl, Janizdreg).
     * Windows Vista/7 8-bit color mode issues (the default is now to
       run in 32-bit color depth on these versions) (thanks to
       everybody who reported this and helped test the fix).
     * Screen borders no longer flash when running on widescreen
       monitors, if you choose a true-color screen mode (thanks
       exp(x)).
     * The controller player in a netgame is the first player to join,
       instead of just being someone who gets lucky.
     * Command line arguments that take an option now check that an
       option is provided (thanks Sander van Dijk).
     * Skill level names in the setup tool are now written the same as
       they are on the in-game "new game" menu (thanks AlexXav).
     * There is no longer a limit on the lengths of filenames provided
       to the -record command line parameter (thanks AlexXav).
     * Window title is not lost in setup tool when changing video
       driver (thanks AlexXav).

    libtextscreen:
     * The font used for the textscreen library can be forced by
       setting the TEXTSCREEN_FONT environment variable to "small" or
       "normal".
     * Tables or scroll panes that don't contain any selectable widgets
       are now themselves not selectable (thanks Proteh).
     * The actions displayed at the bottom of windows are now laid out
       in a more aesthetically pleasing way.

1.4.0 (2010-07-10):

     The biggest change in this version is the addition of OPL
     emulation.  This emulates Vanilla Doom's MIDI playback when
     using a Yamaha OPL synthesizer chip, as was found on
     SoundBlaster compatible cards.

     A software OPL emulator is included as most modern computers do
     not have a hardware OPL chip any more.  If you do have one, you
     can configure Chocolate Doom to use it; see README.OPL.

     The OPL playback feature is not yet perfect or 100% complete,
     but is judged to be good enough for general use.  If you find
     music that does not play back properly, please report it as a
     bug.

     Other changes:
     * The REJECT overflow emulation code from PrBoom+ has been
       imported.  This fixes demo desync on some demos, although
       others will still desync.
     * Warnings are now generated for invalid dehacked replacements of
       printf format strings.  Some potential buffer overflows are
       also checked.
     * The installation instructions (INSTALL file) have been
       clarified and made more platform-agnostic.
     * The mouse is no longer warped to the center of the screen when
       the demo sequence advances.
     * Key bindings can now be changed for the demo recording quit key
       (normally 'q') and the multiplayer messaging keys (normally
       't', 'g', 'i', 'b' and 'r').

1.3.0 (2010-02-10):

     * Chocolate Doom now runs on Windows Mobile/Windows CE!
     * It is possible to rebind most/all of the keys that control the
       menu, shortcuts, automap and weapon switching.  The main
       reason for this is to support the Windows CE port and other
       platforms where a full keyboard may not be present.
     * Chocolate Doom now includes a proper Mac OS X package; it is
       no longer necessary to compile binaries for this system by
       hand.  The package includes a simple graphical launcher
       program and can be installed simply by dragging the "Chocolate
       Doom" icon to the Applications folder. (thanks to Rikard Lang
       for extensive testing and feedback)
     * The video mode auto-adjust code will automatically choose
       windowed mode if no fullscreen video modes are available.
     * The zone memory size is automatically reduced on systems with
       a small amount of memory.
     * The "join game" window in the setup tool now has an option to
       automatically join a game on the local network.
     * Chocolate Doom includes some initial hacks for compiling under
       SDL 1.3.
     * Recent versions of SDL_mixer include rewritten MIDI code on Mac
       OS X.  If you are using a version of SDL_mixer with the new
       code, music will now be enabled by default.
     * Windows Vista and Windows 7 no longer prompt for elevated
       privileges when running the setup tool (thanks hobbs and
       MikeRS).
     * The Windows binaries now have better looking icons (thanks
       MikeRS).
     * Magic values specified using the -spechit command line
       parameter can now be hexadecimal.
     * DOOMWADDIR/DOOMWADPATH can now specify the complete path to
       IWAD files, rather than the path to the directory that contains
       them.
     * When recording shorttics demos, errors caused by the reduced
       turning resolution are carried forward, possibly making turning
       smoother.
     * The source tarball can now be used to build an RPM package:
         rpmbuild -tb chocolate-doom-VER.tar.gz

    Compatibility:
     * The A_BossDeath behavior in v1.9 emulation mode was fixed
       (thanks entryway)
     * The "loading" disk icon is drawn more like how it is drawn in
       Vanilla Doom, also fixing a bug with chook3.wad.
     * Desync on 64-bit systems with ep1-0500.lmp has (at long last)
       been fixed (thanks exp(x)).
     * Donut overrun emulation code imported from Prboom+ (thanks
       entryway).
     * The correct level name should now be shown in the automap for
       pl2.wad MAP33 (thanks Janizdreg).
     * In Chex Quest, the green radiation suit colormap is now used
       instead of the red colormaps normally used when taking damage
       or using the berserk pack.  This matches Vanilla chex.exe
       behavior (thanks Fuzztooth).
     * Impassible glass now displays and works the same as in Vanilla,
       fixing wads such as OTTAWAU.WAD (thanks Never_Again).

    Bugs fixed:
     * Memory-mapped WAD I/O is disabled by default, as it caused
       various issues, including a slowdown/crash with Plutonia 2
       MAP23.  It can be explicitly re-enabled using the '-mmap'
       command line parameter.
     * Crash when saving games due to the ~/.chocolate-doom/savegames
       directory not being created (thanks to everyone who reported
       this).
     * Chocolate Doom will now run under Win95/98, as the
       SetProcessAffinityMask function is looked up dynamically.
     * Compilation under Linux with older versions of libc will now
       work (the semantics for sched_setaffinity were different in
       older versions)
     * Sound clipping when using libsamplerate was improved (thanks
       David Flater)
     * The audio buffer size is now calculated based on the sample
       rate, so there is not a noticeable delay when using a lower
       sample rate.
     * The manpage documentation for the DOOMWADPATH variable was
       fixed (thanks MikeRS).
     * Compilation with FEATURE_MULTIPLAYER and FEATURE_SOUND
       disabled was fixed.
     * Fixed crash when using the donut special type and the joining
       linedef is one sided (thanks Alexander Waldmann).
     * Key settings in a configuration file that are out of range
       do not cause a crash (thanks entryway).
     * Fix ear-piercing whistle when playing the MAP05 MIDI music
       using timidity with EAWPATS (thanks entryway / HackNeyed).

    libtextscreen:
     * There is now a second, small textscreen font, so that the
       ENDOOM screen and setup tool can be used on low resolution
       devices (eg. PDAs/embedded devices)
     * The textscreen library now has a scrollable pane widget. Thanks
       to LionsPhil for contributing code to scroll up and down using
       the keyboard.
     * Doxygen documentation was added for the textscreen library.

1.2.1 (2008-12-10):

    This version just fixes a crash at the intermission screen when
    playing Doom 1 levels.

1.2.0 (2008-12-10):

    Happy 15th Birthday, Doom!

     * Chocolate Doom now has an icon that is not based on the proprietary
       Doom artwork.
     * There is now memory-mapped WAD I/O support, which should be useful
       on some embedded systems.
     * Chex quest emulation support is now included, although an
       auxiliary dehacked patch is needed (chexdeh.zip in the idgames
       archive).

    Compatibility:
     * The armor class is always set to 2 when picking up a megasphere
       (thanks entryway).
     * The quit screen prompts to quit "to dos" instead of just to quit
       (thanks MikeRS)
     * The "dimensional shambler" quit message was fixed.
     * Fix crash related to A_BFGSpray with NULL target when using
       dehacked patches - discovered with insaned2.deh
       (thanks CSonicGo)
     * NUL characters are stripped from dehacked files, to ensure correct
       behavior with some dehacked patches (eg. the one with portal.wad).

    Bugs fixed:
     * "Python Image Library" should have been "Python Imaging Library"
       (thanks exp(x)).
     * The setup tool should no longer ask for elevated permissions
       on Windows Vista (this fix possibly may not work).
     * The application icon is set properly when running under Windows
       XP with the "Luna" theme.
     * Fix compilation under Cygwin to detect libraries and headers from
       the correct environment.
     * The video code does not try to read SDL events before SDL has
       been properly initialised - this was causing problems with some
       older versions of SDL.

1.1.1 (2008-04-20):

    The previous release (v1.1.0) included a bug that broke compilation
    when libsamplerate support was enabled.  The only change in this 
    version is to fix this bug.

1.1.0 (2008-04-19):

     * The video mode code has been radically restructured.  The video mode is
       now chosen by directly specifying the mode to use; the scale factor is
       then chosen to fit the screen.  This is helpful when using widescreen
       monitors (thanks Linguica)
     * MSVC build project files (thanks GhostlyDeath and entryway).
     * Unix manpage improvements; the manpage now lists the environment
       variables that Chocolate Doom uses.  Manpages have been added for
       chocolate-setup and chocolate-server, from the versions for the Debian
       Chocolate Doom package (thanks Jon Dowland).
     * INSTALL file with installation instructions for installing Chocolate
       Doom on Unix systems.
     * Support for high quality resampling of sound effects using 
       libsamplerate (thanks David Flater).
     * A low pass filter is applied when doing sound resampling in an
       attempt to filter out high frequency noise from the resampling
       process.
     * R_Main progress box is not displayed if stdout is a file (produces
       cleaner output).
     * Client/server version checking can be disabled to allow different
       versions of Chocolate Doom to play together, or Chocolate Doom
       clients to play with Strawberry Doom clients.
     * Unix manpages are now generated for the Chocolate Doom 
       configuration files.
     * The BSD PC speaker driver now works on FreeBSD.

    Compatibility:
     * Use the same spechits compatibility value as PrBoom+, for consistency
       (thanks Lemonzest).
     * The intercepts overrun code has been refactored to work on big
       endian machines.
     * The default startup delay has been set to one second, to allow 
       time for the screen to settle before starting the game (some 
       monitors have a delay before they come back on after changing modes).
     * If a savegame buffer overrun occurs, the savegame does not get saved
       and existing savegames are not overwritten (same behaviour as 
       Vanilla).

    Bugs fixed:
     * Desync with STRAIN demos and dehacked Misc values not being set
       properly (thanks Lemonzest)
     * Don't grab the mouse if the mouse is disabled via -nomouse or use_mouse
       in the configuration file (thanks MikeRS).
     * Don't center the mouse on startup if the mouse is disabled (thanks
       Siggi).
     * Reset the palette when the window is restored to clear any screen
       corruption (thanks Catoptromancy).
     * mus2mid.c should use MEM_SEEK_SET, not SEEK_SET (thanks Russell)
     * Fast/Respawn options were not being exchanged when starting netgames
       (thanks GhostlyDeath).
     * Letterbox mode is more accurately described as "pillarboxed" or 
       "windowboxed" where appropriate (thanks MikeRS)
     * Process affinity mask is set to 1 on Windows, to work around a 
       bug in SDL_mixer that can cause crashes on multi-core machines
       (thanks entryway).
     * Bugs in the joystick configuration dialog in the setup tool have
       been fixed.

1.0.0 (2007-12-10):

    This release is dedicated to Dylan 'Toke' McIntosh, who was
    tragically killed in a car crash in 2006.  I knew Dylan
    from IRC and the Doomworld forums for several years, and he had
    a deep passion for this game.  He was also a huge help for me while
    developing Chocolate Doom, as he helped point out a lot of small
    quirks in Vanilla Doom that I didn't know about. His death is a 
    great loss.  RIP Toke.

    This is the first release to reach full feature parity with 
    Vanilla Doom.  As a result, I have made this version 1.0.0, so
    Chocolate Doom is no longer beta!

    Big new features:
     * Multiplayer!  This version includes an entirely new multiplayer
       engine, based on a packet server architecture.  I'd like to thank
       joe, pritch, Meph and myk, and everyone else who has helped test
       the new code for their support, feedback and help in testing this.  
       The new code still needs more testing, and I'm eager to hear any 
       feedback on this.
     * A working setup tool.  This has the same look and feel as the 
       original setup.exe.  I hope people like it!  Note that it has 
       some advantages over the original setup.exe - for example, 
       you can use the mouse.

    Other new features:
     * New mus conversion code thanks to Ben Ryves.  This converts the
       Doom .mus format to .mid a lot better.  As one example, tnt.wad
       Map02 is now a lot closer to how Vanilla says.  Also, the music 
       on the deca.wad titlescreen now plays!
     * x3, x4 and x5 display scale (thanks to MikeRS for x5 scale).
     * Fullscreen "letterbox" mode allows Chocolate Doom to run on machines
       where 1.6:1 aspect ratio modes are unavailable (320x200/640x400).
       The game runs in 320x240/640x480 instead, with black borders.
       The system automatically adjusts to this if closer modes are 
       unavailable.
     * Aspect ratio correction: you can (also) run at 640x480 without black 
       borders at the top and bottom of the screen.
     * PC speaker sound effect support.  Chocolate Doom can output real
       PC speaker sounds on Linux, or emulate a PC speaker through the
       sound card.
     * Working three-screen mode, as seen in early versions of Doom!
       To test this out, put three computers on a LAN and type:
         chocolate-doom -server
	 chocolate-doom -autojoin -left
	 chocolate-doom -autojoin -right
     * Allow a delay to be specified on startup, to allow the display to
       settle after changing modes before starting the game.
     * Allow the full path and filename to be specified when loading demos:
       It is now possible to type 'chocolate-doom -playdemo /tmp/foo.lmp'
       for example.
     * Savegames are now stored in separate directories depending on
       the IWAD: eg. the savegames for Doom II are stored in a different
       place to those for Doom I, Final Doom, etc. (this does not affect
       Windows).
     * New mouse acceleration code works based on a threshold and 
       acceleration.  Hopefully this should be closer to what the DOS
       drivers do.  There is a 'test' feature in the setup tool to help 
       in configuring this.
     * New '-nwtmerge' command line option that emulates NWT's '-merge'
       option.  This allows TiC's Obituary TC to be played.
     * The ENDOOM screen no longer closes automatically, you have to click
       the window to make it go away.
     * Spechit overrun fixes and improvements.  Thanks to entryway for
       his continued research on this topic (and because I stole your
       improvements :-).  Thanks to Quasar for reporting a bug as well.
     * Multiple dehacked patches can be specified on the command line,
       in the same way as with WADs - eg. -deh foo.deh bar.deh baz.deh.
     * Default zone memory size increased to 16MB; this can be controlled
       using the -mb command-line option.
     * It is now possible to record demos of unlimited length (by default, 
       the Vanilla limit still applies, but it can now be disabled).
     * Autoadjusting the screen mode can now be disabled.
     * On Windows, the registry is queried to detect installed versions of
       Doom and automatically locate IWAD files.  IWADs installed through
       Steam are also autodetected.
     * Added DOOMWADPATH that can be used like PATH to specify multiple 
       locations in which to search for IWAD files.  Also, '-iwad' is 
       now enhanced, so that eg. '-iwad doom.wad' will now search all 
       IWAD search paths for 'doom.wad'.
     * Improved mouse tracking that should no longer lag.  Thanks to 
       entryway for research into this.
     * The SDL driver can now be specified in the configuration file.  
       The setup tool has an option on Windows to select between
       DirectX and windib.
     * Joystick support.
     * Configuration file option to change the sound sample rate.
     * More than three mouse buttons are now supported.
     
    Portability improvements: 
     * Chocolate Doom now compiles and runs cleanly on MacOS X.  Huge
       thanks go to Insomniak who kindly gave me an account on his machine
       so that I could debug this remotely.  Big thanks also go to 
       athanatos on the Doomworld forums for his patience in testing 
       various ideas as I tried to get Chocolate Doom up and running
       on MacOS.
     * Chocolate Doom now compiles and runs natively on AMD64.
     * Chocolate Doom now compiles and runs on Solaris/SPARC, including
       the Sun compiler.  Thanks to Mike Spooner for some portability 
       fixes.
     * Improved audio rate conversion, so that sound should play properly
       on machines that don't support low bitrate output.

    Compatibility fixes:
     * Check for IWADs in the same order as Vanilla Doom.
     * Dehacked code will now not allow string replacements to be longer than
       those possible through DOS dehacked.
     * Fix sound effects playing too loud on level 8 (thanks to myk
       for his continued persistence in getting me to fix this)
     * Save demos when quitting normally - it is no longer necessary to
       press 'q' to quit and save a demo.
     * Fix spacing of -devparm mode dots.
     * Fix sky behavior to be the same as Vanilla Doom - when playing in
       Doom II, the skies never change from the sky on the first level
       unless the player loads from a savegame. 
     * Make -nomouse and config file use_mouse work again.
     * Fix the -nomusic command-line parameter.  Make the snd_sfxdevice
       snd_musicdevice values in the configuration file work, so that it
       is possible to disable sound, as with Vanilla.
     * Repeat key presses when the key is held down (this is the Vanilla 
       behavior)  - thanks to Mad_Mac for pointing this out.
     * Don't print a list of all arguments read from response files - Vanilla
       doesn't do this.
     * Autorun only when joyb_speed >= 10, not >= 4.  Thanks to Janizdreg 
       for this.
     * Emulate a bug in DOS dehacked that can overflow the dehacked
       frame table and corrupt the weaponinfo table.  Note that this means
       Batman Doom will no longer play properly (identical behavior
       to Vanilla); vbatman.deh needs to also be applied to fix it.
       (Thanks grazza)
     * Allow dehacked 2.3 patches to be loaded.
     * Add more dehacked string replacements.
     * Compatibility option to enable or disable native key mappings.  This
       means that people with non-US keyboards can decide whether to use
       their correct native mapping or behave like Vanilla mapping (which
       assumes all keyboards are US).
     * Emulate overflow bug in P_FindNextHighestFloor.  Thanks to
       entryway for the fix for this.
     * Add -netdemo command line parameter, for playing back netgame
       demos recorded with a single player.
     * The numeric keypad now behaves like Vanilla Doom does.
     * Fix some crashes when loading from savegames.
     * Add intercepts overrun emulation from PrBoom-plus.  Thanks again
       to entryway for his research on this subject.
     * Add playeringame overrun emulation.

    Bugs fixed:
     * Fix crash when starting new levels due to the intermission screen
       being drawn after the WI_ subsystem is shut down (thanks 
       pritch and joe)
     * Catch failures to initialise sound properly, and fail gracefully.
     * Fix crasher in 1427uv01.lmp (thanks ultdoomer)
     * Fix crash in udm1.wad.
     * Fix crash when loading a savegame with revenant tracer missiles.
     * Fix crash when loading a savegame when a mancubus was in the middle
       of firing.
     * Fix Doom 1 E1-3 intermission screen animations.
     * Fix loading of dehacked "sound" sections.
     * Make sure that modified copyright banners always end in a newline
       - this fixes a bug with av.wad (thanks myk)
     * Added missing quit message ("are you sure you want to quit this
       great game?").
     * Fix when playing long sound effects - the death sound in marina.wad
       now plays properly, for example.
     * Fix buffer overrun on the quicksave prompt screen that caused a
       mysterious cycling character to appear.
     * IDCLEV should not work in net games (thanks Janizdreg)
     * Stop music playing at the ENDOOM screen.
     * Fix sound sample rate conversion crash.
     * Fix 'pop' heard at the end of sound effects.
     * Fix crash when playing long sounds.
     * Fix bug with -timedemo accuracy over multi-level demos.
     * Fix bug with the automap always following player 1 in multiplayer
       mode (thanks Janizdreg).

0.1.4 (2006-02-13):

    NWT-style merging command line options (allows Mordeth to be played)
    Unix manpage (thanks Jon Dowland)
    Dehacked improvements/fixes:
     * Allow changing the names of graphic lumps used in menu, status bar
       intermission screen, etc.
     * Allow changing skies, animated flats + textures
     * Allow changing more startup strings.
     * Allow text replacements on music + sfx lump names
    Fix for plutonia map12 crash.
    Fix bug with playing long sfx at odd sample rates.
    Big Endian fixes (for MacOS X).  Thanks to athanatos for helping
        find some of these.
    Install into /usr/games, rather than /usr/bin (thanks Jon Dowland)

0.1.3 (2006-01-20):

    Imported the spechit overrun emulation code from prboom-plus.  Thanks to
         Andrey Budko for this.
    New show_endoom option in the chocolate-doom.cfg config file allows
         the ENDOOM screen to be disabled.
    Chocolate Doom is now savegame-compatible with Vanilla Doom.

    Fixes for big endian machines (thanks locust)
    Fixed the behavior of the dehacked maximum health setting.
    Fix the "-skill 0" hack to play without any items (thanks to Janizdreg
        for pointing out that this was nonfunctional)
    Fix playing of sounds at odd sample rates (again).  Sound effects at
        any sample rate now play, but only sounds with valid headers.
        This is the *real* way Vanilla Doom behaves.  Thanks to myk for
        pointing out the incorrect behavior.

0.1.2 (2005-10-29):

    Silence sounds at odd sample rates (rather than bombing out); this
        is the way Vanilla Doom behaves.
    Handle multiple replacements of the same sprite in a PWAD.
    Support specifying a specific version to emulate via the command line
        (-gameversion)
    Fix help screen orderings and skull positions.  Behave exactly as
        the original executables do.

0.1.1 (2005-10-18):
    Display startup "banners" if they have been modified through 
        dehacked.
    Dehacked "Misc" section support.

    Bugs fixed:
     * Doom 1 skies always using Episode 1 sky
     * Crash when switching applications while running fullscreen
     * Lost soul bounce logic (do not bounce in Registered/Shareware)
     * Mouse buttons mapped incorrectly (button 1 is right, 2 is middle)
     * Music not pausing when game is paused, when using SDL_mixer's 
       native MIDI playback.
     * Pink icon on startup (palette should be fully set before anything is
       loaded)

    WAD merging for TCs
    ENDOOM display

    Fix uac_dead.wad (platform drop on e1m8 should occur when all
        bosses die, not just barons)
    Fix "loading" icon to work for all graphics modes

0.0.3 (2005-09-17):
    Mouse acceleration code to emulate the behaviour of old
        DOS mouse drivers (thanks to Toke for information about 
        this and suggestions)
